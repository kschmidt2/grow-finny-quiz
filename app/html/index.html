                <p>The IRS <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/irs-extends-tax-filing-deadline/">extended the deadline</a> to file your 2020 federal income taxes in order to give people more time to grapple with the changes laid out in the American Rescue Plan passed earlier this month. <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/tax-deadlines-by-state/">Most states followed suit</a>, extending their tax days to May 17 or later, but be sure to check with your state’s tax agency as soon as possible to avoid potential late-filing penalties.</p>

                  <p>The U.S. has a progressive tax system, which means that people with higher incomes pay higher <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2020">federal income tax rates</a>. However, the amount of tax you pay isn’t dictated by the tax bracket where your income falls, but rather <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/federal-income-tax-brackets/">the rates leading up to and including that rate</a>.</p>
                  <p>For instance, if your taxable income was $50,000 in 2020, you’d be taxed at a rate of 10% on the first $9,875, 12% on the next $30,250, and 22% on the last $9,875. This would make your effective tax rate, or the amount you actually pay, 13.6%.</p>
